I asked if all J-sets are strong J-sets.  By a simple argument due to Hindman, the answer is "yes".  The argument follows from the observation that if piecewise syndetic sets contain the S(1,F) property, then they contain the S(k,F) property for all natural numbers k.  Then we only have to show that J-sets satisfy the S(1,F) property to conclude that all J-sets are strong.  In particular this helps to simplify the noncommutative version of CST considerably.
