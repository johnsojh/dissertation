    \textbf{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
  \end{center}

  I wish to thank my advisor, Dr.~Hindman, for his saintly patience, open, honest and quick communication, and his phenomenal mathematical ideas and guidance. 
  Without his support, this dissertation would not have been written.  
  I hope that I have proved a few theorems here that Dr.~Hindman can be proud of.

  I also want to thank the wonderful (and often unappreciated!) Howard Mathematics Department. 
  (Particularly, Dr.~Ramaroson who gave me my first little taste of mathematics research several years ago.)

  I'm eternally grateful to the Bridge to the Doctorate (Dr.~Lee and the excellent staff help ease my transition into Howard); GK12 (Dr.~Alfred miraculously ran this excellent program himself!); and Preparing Future Faculty programs for tuition and (great!) stipend funding throughout the years.  
  Without these programs, I would not have been able to participate in graduate education!

  I also wish to thank the mathematics department at James Madison University for welcoming me into their department during the 2010--2011 academic year, and providing me with my first `real' job for the 2011--2012 academic year.  

  I also want to thank my fellow Howard graduate students. 
  You all provided many laughs and much heap throughout the years.

  Thank you Camelia for your wonderful and loving support (and patience!) these last three years.

  Finally, I wish to thank my family for just being themselves!
