% The following is a dissertation template that meets the Howard
% University specifications.

% Howard University requires a 12 point type Times New Roman (or
% Helvetica) font. Before submitting a final draft, change the DRAFT
% option to FINAL and remove the SHOWTRIMS option.

\documentclass[letterpaper, 12pt, oneside, showtrims, draft]{memoir}

% Top, right, bottom, and left margins must be 1 inch each from the
% edge. Using the geometry package with the options 'margin=1in' is a
% convenient way to accomplish this.
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}  

% The amsthm package is used to provide the theorem-type and proof
% environments that make typesetting theorems and definitions easy.
\usepackage{amsthm}

% This modification of the plain theorem style template uses slanted
% fonts instead of italic fonts in the theorem statement. I prefer
% this style since in the older style you can confuse the variables
% with the "regular" text.
\newtheoremstyle{plain}
  {3mm}                         % Space above theorem and previous line.
  {3mm}                         % Space below theorem box and next line.
  {\slshape}                    % Use slanted font in body of theorem.
  {}                            % Indent amount from margin. (Here no indent.)
  {\bfseries}                   % Theorem head font.
  {.}                           % Punctation after theorem head.
  {.5em}                        % Space after theorem head.
  {}                            % Theorem head specification.

Bartel Leendert van der Waerden in \cite{Van-der-Waerden:1927fk} proved the following remarkable assertion about arithmetic progressions in the positive integers.


  Let $r$ and $k$ be positive integers.
  Then there exists a positive integer $N$ such that if $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\} = \bigcup_{i=1}^r C_i$, then there exists $i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, r\}$ such that $C_i$ contains a $k$-term arithmetic progression, that is, there exist positive integers $a$ and $d$ with $\{a, a+d, \ldots, a + (k-1)d\} \subseteq C_i$.
