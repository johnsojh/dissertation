2.  Algebraic and Topological Preliminaries
    
    A _semigroup_ is a pair (S, *) such that S is a nonempty set and *
    is an associative binary operation on S, that is, for all x, y,
    and z in S, x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z.  As usual in mathematics we will
    often suppress the explicit mention of our binary operation * by
    simply saying S is a semigroup.  Clearly any group is also a
    semigroup, but the standard canonical example of a semigroup that
    is not a group is simply the set of natural numbers under
    addition.  Another class of examples can be obtained by
    considering the multiplicative part of a ring.  In analogy with
    the definition of a commutative ring, we define a _commutative
    semigroup_ as a semigroup such that for all x and y, xy = yx. Also
    in analogy with ring theory, we can define certain ideals in
    semigroups. Given a semigroup S and a nonempty subset I of S, we
    say I is a _left ideal (of S)_ iff SI is contained in I; we say I
    is a _right ideal (of S)_ iff IS is contained in I; and, finally,
    we say I is a _(two-sided) ideal (of S)_ iff I is both a left
    ideal and right ideal.  (The phrases in parentheses will often be
    omitted if they are clear from context.)

    The study of ideals in semigroups is one of the main differences
    between semigroup theory and group theory.  (A semigroup is a
    group if and only if the only left and right ideals are the whole
    semigroup itself.)  Moreover, semigroup theory is different from
    ring theory as the following simple example shows that not every
    semigroup can be embedded as the multiplicative part of some ring.  

    Example.  We call (S, *) a _right-zero semigroup_ iff for all x, y
    in S, x*y = y.  A simple check shows that this is really a
    semigroup. The name "right-zero" is derived from the fact that, in
    the natural numbers, multiplying on the right by zero yields
    zero.  Hence in a right-zero semigroup every element is "zero".  

    Suppose that S is a right-zero semigroup with |S| > 2.  We claim
    that S cannot be the multiplicative "part" of any ring.  Suppose,
    to the contrary, that there exists such a ring.  Then for all a,
    b, and c in S, we have that (b+c)*a = b*a + c*a by the ring
    axioms.  Since S is right-zero, we have that (b+c)*a = a and b*a
    = a = c*a.  Hence a = a + a and this implies that a = 0. Since |S|
    > 2, it follows that there exists a, b in S with a != b and a = 0
    = b. 
    Example.
    
    We call a left ideal L of a semigroup _minimal_ iff L doesn't
    contain any proper left ideals.  We define the concept of a
    _minimal right ideal_ dually, and a we call an ideal I _minimal_
    iff it contains no proper ideal.  Even though much of the
    literature in semigroup theory mentions minimal ideals, we won't
    use this terminology since it follows that a semigroup has at most
    one minimal ideal and this ideal is contained in every ideal of
    the semigroup.  Therefore we refer to the minimal ideal as the
    _smallest ideal_.

    Proposition.  Let S be a semigroup and let K be an ideal of S.  If
    K is a minimal ideal and I is an ideal of S, then K is contained
    in I.
    Proof.  Observe that K intersected with I is nonempty.  (If x is
    in K and y in I, then xy in K and I since they are both ideals.)
    Hence K intersect I is contained in K and I.  Since K is minimal,
    K = K intersect I and so K is contained in I.                   []

    With these result we are justified in making the following
    important definition.

    Definition.  Let S be a semigroup. If S has a minimal ideal, then
    we call this ideal the _smallest ideal_ and denote it by
    K(S). *Endnote for why this is called K(S)*  

    Not all semigroups possess a smallest ideal, for instance, (N, +)
    and (N, *) don't have smallest ideals.  However, for the class of
    semigroups we shall consider, we are guaranteed a smallest ideal.
    
    We shall not move on to define how topology can interact with our
    semigroup operations in various ways; but, the reader interested
    in the (purely) algebraic theory of semigroups can consult the
    article [Hollings:2007uq] for a very brief introduction to
    semigroup theory or the monograph [Clifford:1961fk] for much more
    detail. 

    *Endnote for why this is called K(S)*  The use of K(S) to denote
     the smallest ideal is derived from early semigroup research done
     by Suschkewitsch in [Suschkewitsch:1928kx].  In this paper,
     Suschkewitsch investigates the structure of finite semigroups.
     He is able to prove that a finite semigroup has minimal left
     ideals, minimal right ideals, and a smallest ideal which he
     denotes by [Fraktur K] and calls the kernel of the semigroup.
     Additionally, he proves that the smallest ideal is the union of
     all the minimal left ideals and the union of all the minimal
     right ideals and he obtains a structure theorem on the smallest
     ideal.  I haven't personally read this Suschkewitsch paper, so
     the above summary is based on Appendix A of [Clifford:1961fk],
     the brief biography of Suschkewitsch in [Hollings:2009uq], and
     the unpublished note of [Hollings:2005vn]. 
    
    Definition. 

    (a)  A _right-topological semigroup_ is a triple (S, T, *) such that
    	 (S, T) is a topological space, (S, *) is a semigroup, and for all
	 x in S, rho_x is continuous. 

    (b)  A _left-topological semigroup_ is a triple (S, T, *) such that
         (S,T) is a topological space, (S, *) is a semigroup, and for all x
    	 in S, lambda_x is continuous.

    (c)	 A _semitopological semigroup_ is a right-topological semigroup
    	 which is also a left-topological semigroup. (With the same
    	 underlying topology.)

    (d)  A _topological semigroup_ is a triple (S, T, *) such that (S,
         T) is a topological space, (S, *) is a semigroup, and * : S x
         S -> S is continuous in the product topology of S x S. 

It's clear that  (d) -> (c), (c) -> (a), (c) -> (b), but it's known 
known that non of these implications reverse.  (See Exercises 2.1.1 and
2.1.2 in [Hindman:1998fk].)  Since the theories of left-topological
and right-topological semigroups are "dual", it's a matter of taste which
one we chose to work in.  We follow [Hindman:1998fk] and develop our
theory in terms of right-topological semigroups.  Again, following
[Hindman:1998fk] we make the further restriction, and only consider
Hausdorff spaces.  Hence from now on whenever we mention a topological
space, we assume that it is Hausdorff. 

4.  Central Sets Theorem

So far we have only stated the Central Sets Theorem for commutative
semigroups.  However there is a version of the Central Sets Theorem
valid for all semigroups.  Before we state this version however, it
may be convenient to explore the motivation behind this 

Since the noncommutative version of the Central Sets Theorem requires
somewhat more 

Rewrite
----------

One of the earliest Ramsey Theoretic results is van der Waerden's
Theorem.  This theorem can be stated in many equivalent ways, but we
chose to give the following formulation.

  Van der Waerden's Theorem.  Given r, l in N, if N = C_1 U C_2 U ... U
  C_r, then there exist i in {1, 2, ..., r} and a, d in N such that 
  {a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+ld} is contained in C_i.  

The conclusion of this theorem can be rewritten to apply to any
semigroups and it may be surprising to find out that the corresponding
result follows directly from VDW. 

  Theorem.  Let S be a semigroup, and let r,l be in N.  If S = C_1 U
  C_2 U ... U C_r, then there exist i in {1, 2, ..., r} and a, d in S
  such that {a, ad, ad^2, ..., ad^l} is contained in C_i.

  Pf. Let x be in S and consider the set {x^n : n in N}.  For each i
  in {1, 2, ..., r} define B_i = { n in N : x^n in C_i }.  Then N =
  B_1 U B_2 U ... B_r.  Moreover, we can apply van der Waerden's
  Theorem to pick i in {1, 2, ... r} and b,c in N such that {b, b+c,
  ... b+lc} is contained in B_i.  By definition of B_i, this means
  that {x^b, x^{b+c}, ..., x^{b+lc}} is contained in C_i.  Put a = x^b
  and d = x^c.
  []

However, there are two potential problems with such a straightforward
approach: Our increment d may be a right identity element in our
semigroup; and even if d is not an identity element, there is no
guarantee that ad^i is distinct for every i.

  Example.  As an example of the first problem, consider a left-zero
  semigroup.  (A semigroup (S, *) is a left-zero semigroup if and only
  if for all x,y in S x*y = x.  The name "left-zero" is derived from
  the fact that, in the natural numbers, multiplying on the left by
  zero yields zero.  Hence in a left-zero semigroup every element
  behaves like zero when multiplied on the left.)  Observe that in a
  left-zero semigroup, every element is a right identity.  Hence {a,
  ad, ..., ad^l} = {a} for every a, d in S.

  Example.  As an example of the second problem, let p be in N and let
  G be the infinite direct sum of cyclic groups with order p (Z/pZ).
  We show that if l > p, then for all x in G, the elements in {a, ad,
  ..., ad^l} cannot all be distinct.

  In particular, let d in G not be the identity. Then d^p = 1, where 1
  is the identity in G, and so a = ad^p. 

  To help avoid the first problem, we strengthen the conclusion of van der
  Waerden's Theorem.  (However, note that we cannot always guarantee
  that the first problem will not occur as our example shows.)

  Theorem.  Let <y_n> be a sequence in N and let r, l be in in.  If N
  = C_1 U C_2 U ... C_r, then there exist i in {1, 2, ... ,r}, a in N,
  and d in FS(<y_n>) such that {a, a+d, ..., a + ld} is contained in
  C_i.

  The reason we prefer this strengthen version of van der Waerden's
  Theorem has to do with the following fact.  [Which is strictly
  stronger?]

  Proposition.  Let S be a left-cancellative semigroup.  If D is an
  infinite subset of S, then there exists a sequence < x_n > in D such
  that all finite products are distinct.  (That is, for all F, G
  finite subsets of N, if F != G, then prod_{n in F} x_n != prod_{n in
  G} x_n. 

  Pf. ???
  []

  Corollary.  FP(<x_n>) doesn't contain a right identity. 
 
  The strengthen version of van der Waerden's Theorem follows from
  another result known as the Hales-Jewett Theorem (as we shall soon
  see).  Moreover, this version is known to hold for commutative
  semigroups.  (Same proof as before.  To ensure that d is not a right
  identity simply make sure our commutative semigroup is
  left-cancellative and apply the above result.) 

  However the analogue of the strengthen version of van der Waerden's
  Theorem fails to hold for all noncommutative semigroups.

  Example.  Let < y_n > be  a sequence of distinct objects and let S
  be the free semigroup generated by the alphabet {y_1, y_2, ...}.
  ... [continued in nonComVDW.pdf file].

  Definition. Let S be a semigroup and * an element not in S.

    (a)  For n in N, we call x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) in (S U {*})^n a
         _variable point_ if and only if there exists i in {1, 2, ...,
         n} such that x_i = *.

    (b)	 Given a variable point x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) and s in S,
         we let x(s) = (x_1(s), x_2(s), ..., x_n(s)) represent the
         point in S^n where x_i(s) = x_i if x_i in S or x_i(s) = s if
         x_i = *.

    (c)  A set C contained in S is a _combinatorial line_ if and only
         if there exists a variable point x = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) and
         a finite nonempty subset F of S such that C = { x_1(s)x_2(s)
         ... x_n(s) : s in F }.

    (d)  A set A contained in S is an _algebraic line_ if and only if
         there exist a,d in S and l in N such that A = {a, ad, ...,
         ad^l}. 

It's easy to see the following fact.

     Proposition.  Let S be a semigroup.  If A subset of S contains an
     algebraic line, then A contains a combinatorial line. 

     Fact?  Let S be a semigroup.  There exists a combinatorial line
     which is not an algebraic line. 

So we give the following analogue of van der Waerden's Theorem that
handles such cases nicely.

     Theorem.  Let V be an infinite-dimensional vector space over a
     finite field F and let r be in N.  If V = C_1 U C_2 U ... U C_r,
     then there exists i in {1, 2, ..., r} such that C_i has the
     following property:
         
	 for every n in N, there exists a subspace W of V with dim W
	 >= n, such that for some a in V, a + W is contained in C_i. 

Combinatorial Motivation

We start by looking at one of the earliest Ramsey Theoretic result,
van der Waerden's Theorem.  This theorem is the motivation for much of
the contemporary research in Ramsey Theory, and for us it will serve a
similar purpose.  One particular formulation of this theorem is the
following.

	Van der Waerden's Theorem.  Let r, l be in N.  If N = C_1 U
	C_2 U ... U C_r, then there exist i in {1, 2, ..., r} and a,d
	in N such that {a, a+d, ..., a+ld} is contained in C_i. 

As we hinted at, van der Waerden's Theorem can be written in many
equivalent forms.  The following is an incomplete list of some
equivalent forms of van der Waerden's Theorem.  (A more complete list
can be found in [Landman:2004fk, Theorem 2.5].  Unfortunately, as far
as I know, no one has collected together all of the currently known
equivalent statements of van der Waerden's Theorem.)

	Theorem 1. 


The conclusion of each of these equivalent forms can be rewritten to
apply to any semigroup, and moreover, the corresponding result follows
directly from van der Waerden's Theorem itself.  The first result we
shall derive from Theorem 1(a) is the following.

        Theorem 2.
