2.  Algebraic and Topological Preliminaries
    
    A _semigroup_ is a pair (S, *) such that S is a nonempty set and *
    is an associative binary operation on S, that is, for all x, y,
    and z in S, x*(y*z) = (x*y)*z.  As usual in mathematics we will
    often suppress the explicit mention of our binary operation * by
    simply saying S is a semigroup.  Clearly any group is also a
    semigroup, but the standard canonical example of a semigroup that
    is not a group is simply the set of natural numbers under
    addition.  Another class of examples can be obtained by
    considering the multiplicative part of a ring.  In analogy with
    the definition of a commutative ring, we define a _commutative
    semigroup_ as a semigroup such that for all x and y, xy = yx. Also
    in analogy with ring theory, we can define certain ideals in
    semigroups. Given a semigroup S and a nonempty subset I of S, we
    say I is a _left ideal (of S)_ iff SI is contained in I; we say I
    is a _right ideal (of S)_ iff IS is contained in I; and, finally,
    we say I is a _(two-sided) ideal (of S)_ iff I is both a left
    ideal and right ideal.  (The phrases in parentheses will often be
    omitted if they are clear from context.)

    The study of ideals in semigroups is one of the main differences
    between semigroup theory and group theory.  (A semigroup is a
    group if and only if the only left and right ideals are the whole
    semigroup itself.)  Moreover, semigroup theory is different from
    ring theory as the following simple example shows that not every
    semigroup can be embedded as the multiplicative part of some ring.  

    Example.  We call (S, *) a _right-zero semigroup_ iff for all x, y
    in S, x*y = y.  A simple check shows that this is really a
    semigroup. The name "right-zero" is derived from the fact that, in
    the natural numbers, multiplying on the right by zero yields
    zero.  Hence in a right-zero semigroup every element is "zero".  

    Suppose that S is a right-zero semigroup with |S| > 2.  We claim
    that S cannot be the multiplicative "part" of any ring.  Suppose,
    to the contrary, that there exists such a ring.  Then for all a,
    b, and c in S, we have that (b+c)*a = b*a + c*a by the ring
    axioms.  Since S is right-zero, we have that (b+c)*a = a and b*a
    = a = c*a.  Hence a = a + a and this implies that a = 0. Since |S|
    > 2, it follows that there exists a, b in S with a != b and a = 0
    = b. 
    Example.
    
    We call a left ideal L of a semigroup _minimal_ iff L doesn't
    contain any proper left ideals.  We define the concept of a
    _minimal right ideal_ dually, and a we call an ideal I _minimal_
    iff it contains no proper ideal.  Even though much of the
    literature in semigroup theory mentions minimal ideals, we won't
    use this terminology since it follows that a semigroup has at most
    one minimal ideal and this ideal is contained in every ideal of
    the semigroup.  Therefore we refer to the minimal ideal as the
    _smallest ideal_.

    Proposition.  Let S be a semigroup and let K be an ideal of S.  If
    K is a minimal ideal and I is an ideal of S, then K is contained
    in I.
    Proof.  Observe that K intersected with I is nonempty.  (If x is
    in K and y in I, then xy in K and I since they are both ideals.)
    Hence K intersect I is contained in K and I.  Since K is minimal,
    K = K intersect I and so K is contained in I.                   []

    With these result we are justified in making the following
    important definition.

    Definition.  Let S be a semigroup. If S has a minimal ideal, then
    we call this ideal the _smallest ideal_ and denote it by
    K(S). *Endnote for why this is called K(S)*  

    Not all semigroups possess a smallest ideal, for instance, (N, +)
    and (N, *) don't have smallest ideals.  However, for the class of
    semigroups we shall consider, we are guaranteed a smallest ideal.
    
    We shall not move on to define how topology can interact with our
    semigroup operations in various ways; but, the reader interested
    in the (purely) algebraic theory of semigroups can consult the
    article [Hollings:2007uq] for a very brief introduction to
    semigroup theory or the monograph [Clifford:1961fk] for much more
    detail.
